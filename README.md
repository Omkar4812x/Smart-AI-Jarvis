Smart AI JARVIS is a **voice-controlled virtual assistant built using Python**, inspired by Iron Man’s JARVIS.  
This repository represents **Part 3** of the series, focusing on **real system automation and productivity features**.

This project demonstrates how **AI + Voice + OS Automation** can work together in real-world applications.

---

## 📌 What This Project Does

In **Part 3**, JARVIS can:

1. 🎙️ Listen to your voice
2. 🧠 Understand your command
3. ⚙️ Control system applications
4. 📝 Write and save text automatically

All without touching the keyboard or mouse.

## 🚀 Features (Explained Clearly)

### 🔊 1. Open & Close Applications by Voice
JARVIS can:
- Open **Notepad**
- Open **Excel**
- Close running applications using voice commands

Example commands:
- “Open Notepad”
- “Open Excel”
- “Close Notepad”

---

### 📝 2. Write Essay in Notepad & Save Automatically
You can:
- Speak an essay or paragraph
- JARVIS writes it inside Notepad
- Saves the file automatically

This is useful for:
- Students
- Content creators
- Hands-free writing

---

## 🧠 Internal Working (Step-by-Step)

1. **Voice Input**
   - Microphone listens to the user
   - Converts speech to text

2. **Command Processing**
   - Text is analyzed
   - Keywords like *open*, *close*, *write* are detected

3. **Action Execution**
   - Opens/closes apps
   - Writes content into files
   - Saves output automatically

4. **Voice Response**
   - JARVIS responds using text-to-speech

## 📄 File-by-File Explanation (VERY IMPORTANT)

### 🔹 `main.py`
➡️ **Main entry point of the project**

- Starts JARVIS
- Calls voice input
- Routes commands to correct modules
- Controls the full workflow

Think of this as **JARVIS’s brain starter**.

---

### 🔹 `automation.py`
➡️ **System automation logic**

Handles:
- Opening Notepad
- Opening Excel
- Closing applications

Uses:
- `os`
- `subprocess`

This file gives JARVIS **real system power**.

---

### 🔹 `voice_manager.py`
➡️ **Voice input & output**

Functions:
- Listen to user voice
- Convert speech → text
- Speak responses using text-to-speech

Core libraries:
- `SpeechRecognition`
- `pyttsx3`

Without this file, JARVIS cannot talk or listen.

---

### 🔹 `memory_brain.py`
➡️ **Command understanding**

Responsibilities:
- Understand what the user wants
- Decide whether it’s an open, close, or write command
- Pass correct action to automation or writing logic

Acts like **decision-making brain**.

---

### 🔹 `prompts.py`
➡️ **AI prompt storage**

- Stores text prompts
- Helps structure responses
- Used for future AI expansion

Keeps the project clean and modular.

---

### 🔹 `youtube_helper.py`
➡️ **Future expansion module**

- Reserved for YouTube-related features
- Not heavily used in Part 3
- Shows scalability of the project

Very useful for later episodes.

---

### 🔹 `setup_project.py`
➡️ **Initial setup file**

- Handles configuration
- Prepares environment
- Used during first-time setup

---

### 🔹 `requirements.txt`
➡️ **All required Python dependencies**

Example:
```txt
speechrecognition
pyttsx3
pyaudio




----
This ensures anyone can run the project easily.

🔹 templates/index.html

➡️ Frontend template (optional)

Used for future web-based UI

Not core to Part 3

Shows readiness for web integration

🔹 index.html

➡️ Basic UI / placeholder

Not required for core logic

Useful for demos and future UI expansion
